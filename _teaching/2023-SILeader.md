Supported MATH 20B (Calculus II) and  PHYS 2B (Electricity & Magnetism) courses by leading in-person and remote sessions that utilize fun, creative methods to review important concepts covered in lectures. Supported students earned on average half to a full letter grade higher than the peers who do not, and feedback received indicated students have a more positive attitude towards the subject.
