## Independent Trials

Did the event $E$ occur exactly $k$ times in $n$ trials?

→ If $E$ does not occur at trial #$i$, then $E^c$ did occur. 

One example of getting exactly $k$ occurrences of $E$ in $n$ trials looks like this: 

The probability of this particular occurrence is: $P(E) P(E)…P(E)~\cdot~P(E^c)P(E^c)... P(E^c)\\=P(E)^k P(E^c)^{n-k}$

But, $E$ can happen anywhere within $n$, then we multiplied by $\binom{n}{k}$. So, the probability the event $E$ occurs $k$ times out of $n$ trials is 

$$
\binom{n}{k} P(E)^k P(E^c)^{n-k}
$$

Repeatedly roll a die What is the probability we get either 1 or 2 before we get a 3?

Solution: 

Define events: 

- $A=$ “get 1 or 2”
- $B=$ “get 3”
- $C=$ “neither” $=$ “get 4,5, or 6”

Note: $AB=\emptyset$

Want $P(A~\text{before}~B)$

$\frac{P(A)}{P(A)+P(B)}$     → This formula only apply if $AB=\emptyset$. 

## Random Variable

→ Convert experiment outcome into numbers. Also can convert number to another number. 

Example: 

$S=\{\text{apple, banana, pear}\}$

Random variable $X$ does this: 

- $X(\text{apple})=3$
- $X(\text{banana})=3$
- $X(\text{pear})=e^{\pi}$

> Def: A random variable is a function that maps each outcome in a sample space to a real number. Formally, $X:S\to \mathbb{R}$.

Example: Flip 3 coins. $S=\{HHH,…,TTT\}$

Let $X$ be a random variable which counts how many Heads we get in an outcome: 

- $X(HHH)=3$
- $X(HHT)=X(HTH)=X(THH)=2$
- $\vdots$

So, we can say $P(X=2)=P(\{HHT,HTH,THH\})=\frac{3}{8}$. 

Note: the notation “$X=2$” here really means the event $\{HHT,HTH,THH\}$. 

Random Variable is given the name because if we don’t what’s under the hood, we just know that $X=2$, but don’t know what it actually represents.
