## What is an OS?

- Code that sits between applications and hardware
- Provides abstractions to layers above
- Implements abstractions for and manages resources below

---

## Hardware of a Typical Computer
- System bus, CPUs, Memory, Network, Storage

---

## Software of a Typical (Unix) System

**User Level:**
- Application (user code, library calls)
- Libraries (compiled, header-defined interfaces)

**Kernel Level:**
- Portable OS Layer
- Machine-dependent Layer
- Bootstrap, System initialization
- Interrupts, Exceptions
- I/O device drivers, Memory management
- Processor & mode management

> Note: “kernel” ≈ “OS”

---

## Questions for this lecture

- How do we separate the OS layer from apps (and libraries)?
- How do we cross between these layers?
- With support from the hardware!

---

## Protection Mechanisms

- **Privileged instructions**
- **Memory protection**

## OS Interactions

- **Faults**
- **System calls**
- **Interrupts**

---

## Dual-Mode Operation

- Kernel mode: Can run all instructions
- User mode: Restricted, non-privileged instructions
- Mode indicated by a mode bit in a protected CPU control register

---

## Privileged Instructions

- Only executable in kernel mode
- CPU checks mode bit before executing
- Privileged actions include:
  - Direct I/O access
  - Memory management state changes
  - Protected register manipulation

---

## Example of a Privileged Instruction

- `HLT`: halts the CPU (only works in kernel mode)

---

## Memory Protection

- OS must:
  - Protect itself from user programs
  - Protect programs from each other
- Memory-management hardware enables protection:
  - Page tables, segmentation, TLB
  - Requires privileged instructions to configure

---

## Events

- **Definition**: An unnatural change in control flow
  - Stops current execution
  - May change context/mode
- OS defines handlers for each event type
- Kernel mode execution only triggered by an event

---

## Types of Events

- **Interrupts**: From external events (e.g., I/O, timers)
- **Exceptions** (Traps):
  - Caused by instruction execution
  - Include faults (e.g., privileged instruction) and system calls

---

## Faults

- Examples: divide by zero, page fault
- CPU:
  - Saves state
  - Switches to kernel mode
  - Finds & executes the appropriate fault handler
- Handler reverses these steps to return control

---

## Handling Faults

### Recovery
- OS may "fix" the issue (e.g., page fault)
- User program resumes after correction

### Termination
- If unrecoverable:
  - Kill process (no handler)
  - Write core dump, terminate

- **Kernel faults** = system crash:
  - Unix panic, Windows BSOD

---

## System Calls

- Interface between user programs and OS
- Performed using special instructions

### Categories:
- Process, memory, file, device management
- Communication

---

## System Call Mechanism

- System call instruction causes an exception
  - Transfers control to kernel
  - Passes syscall number
  - Saves/restores state
- Requires hardware support for context switch

---

## Examples of System Call Instructions

- `INT`: triggers syscall
- `SYSCALL`: on newer 64-bit CPUs

---

## System Call Example

```plaintext
User level:       read()
                    ↓
Library:          INT $0x03
                    ↓
Kernel:           read() routine
                    ↓
Return to user level
```

- Syscall numbers assigned by OS

---

## Referencing Data Between Spaces

- OS and user code have different address spaces
- Use **names/handles**, not raw pointers (e.g., file descriptors)

---

## Interrupts

- Triggered by hardware (timers, I/O)
- **Precise** on modern CPUs (instruction boundaries)

### Handling:
- Disable lower-priority interrupts
- Save state
- Execute ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)
- Re-enable interrupts
- Resume execution

---

## Example: Timer Interrupt

- Timer generates interrupt periodically
- Privileged instruction sets timer
- Used to:
  - Reclaim CPU (scheduling)
  - Enforce time limits
  - Sleep/delays

---

## Example: I/O Interrupt

- OS starts I/O → Device completes → Sends interrupt
- CPU context switches to ISR
- Resumes original process

---

## The OS as a Giant Interrupt Handler

- All kernel entry via:
  - Timer/I/O interrupts
  - Faults
  - System calls

```plaintext
[User Level] → [Event] → [Kernel Level]
→ Dispatcher → Fault Handler / ISR / Syscall Handler
```

---

## Practice Question

- After the call to `main()`, how many mode switches does the program perform?

---

## Summary

### Protection:
- Privileged instructions
- Memory protection

### OS Interactions:
- Faults
- System calls
- Interrupts
